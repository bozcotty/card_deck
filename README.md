# A Deck of Cards


## Description
This exercise involved modeling a deck of cards. First I created a card object with rank and suit attributes. Then I created a deck using the Ruby product method to join an array of suits to an array of ranks, producing 52 cards.

Feature tests were run to check that cards had a rank and suit, and that the new card_array created by the Deck class in deck_spec.rb had 52 cards in it.
